<p>Github just greeted me with:<br />
<pre><code>ERROR: Hi hoodie, it's GitHub. We're doing an SSH key audit.
 Please visit https://github.com/settings/ssh/audit/679304
 to approve this key so we know it's safe.</code></pre><br />
It&#8217;s nice that they took that <a title="golem artikel" href="http://www.golem.de/news/programmierfehler-ruby-on-rails-repository-bei-github-kompromittiert-1203-90252.html">hack</a> seriously.</p>
