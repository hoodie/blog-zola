<p>Over the weekend I head the pleasure to attend the <a title="libregraphicsmeeting" href="http://libregraphicsmeeting.org/2014">libregraphicsmeeting</a> as a spectator. It was fascinating and fun both attending workshops and talks given by some of the original developers of Gimp, Krita, Inkscape, darktable, mypaint, blender etc and also to get to socialize with people who work in FLOSS part time or full time. I would love to get a Job in FLOSS as well once I got my diploma, let&#8217;s see what I can do about that.</p>
<p>But I actually wanted to post something about <a href="http://naubino.de"><strong>Naubino!</strong></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s still at the stage of a 1.0beta4 or something like that but I had the chance to add a few more levels. In may, when I got a little bit more free time I&#8217;ll try to fix some touch quirks so it will work the way what we intended it to work on touch enabled laptops, which have become more popular since I stopped working on roughly 2 years ago&#8230;.</p>
<p>But what I actually did during the <a title="libregraphicsmeeting" href="http://libregraphicsmeeting.org/2014">LGM</a> was creating a new version of Naubino, mostyle inspired by the fabulous <a href="http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/">2048</a> which has gotten us all addicted. I call it <a title="Naubino 2048" href="http://naubino.de/2048">Naubino 2048</a>.</p>
<p>Have Fun</p>
