<p>After the unfortunate incident when my beloved iRiver h320 dropped out of my pocket and its harddrive spun its last spin I needed to find a replacement soon. Quickly my eyes fell upon the Sansa Clip+. Its small, plays OGG Vorbis and with an additional 7.4gb microSD Card even comes within a 3Gb reach of the original size of my iRivers 18GB.<br />
But after only a few hours I had to discover that there is a major flaw in the system. Nothing serious really. It only tends to FREEZE UP loading its POINTLESS media library for NO GOOD REASON when I put certain .ogg files on it. At least that&#8217;s what I believe causes the problem, for no one around the webs seems to have found the reason or even a fix for this problem. I spend an entire night on trying to find out which of my musicfiles couses the freezing up but there was just no clue.</p>
<p>So I tried to put Rockbox on it and I got to admit &#8211; it still does not really solve the problem. Because the port to this device does not support USB yet &#8211; meaning that you would have to start the original firmware to connect. Which means that the player would have to be able to start in the first place.</p>
<p>Apparently the glitch does not occur when I have no .ogg files on the player but .oga files <img src="/images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":/" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> so I hope I can keep on using the player like this until either the rockbox people fix the usb support in an upcoming version or &#8230; the replacement harddrive for my iriver I ordered in Hongkong finally arrives.</p>
<p>Anyhow &#8230; there are no good portable audio players out there at the moment &#8211; what a sad sad world we live in.</p>
<p>PS: can I start a petition that we stop saying &#8220;mp3player&#8221; &#8211; because mp3 is soo dead in 2010. Some people only talk of iPods, I like the term <abbr title="anything but an iPod">abi</abbr> but really what all of them are is a <abbr title="portable audio player">PAP</abbr>. Just for the record.</p>
