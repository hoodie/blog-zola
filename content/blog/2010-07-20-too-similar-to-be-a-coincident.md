<p>Oh foobar2000! Today pledge I thee my uttermost affection. You might be the most brilliantly designed example of an audio player and yet &#8211; there is but a fatal flaw about you. You only come on win<a href="/images/uploads/2010/07/deadbeef1.png"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-140" title="deadbeef1" src="/images/uploads/2010/07/deadbeef1-150x150.png" alt="" width="231" height="231" /></a>dows.</p>
<p>For quite a while I&#8217;ve been seeking out alternatives and finally settled with Amarok. Amarok has lost quite a few features due to its being rewritten but its catching up again. Still, there is hardly anything in the linuxworld that is like foobar2000 &#8211; unless you count foobar2000 itself, running on wine.</p>
<p>At least so I thought, till I stumbled upon a project with the name of deadbeef. It is still very young, hardly year. And it is still very simple. Let me sum up some of its features:</p>
<ul>
<li>playback of all important audio formats and streams</li>
<li>editing of all kinds of meta-tag formats</li>
<li>very foobarlike look</li>
<li>very foobarlike playlist search</li>
<li>very foobarlike sorting</li>
<li>gapless playback</li>
<li>last.fm scrobbling</li>
<li>very foobarlike playlist tabs</li>
<li>tag editor (also very much like in foobar)</li>
</ul>
<p>and I could go on.</p>
<p>Even better is the fact that this player seams to be an absolute light weight. It takes less then a second to start and uses hardly more then 9mb of memory.</p>
<p><a href="/images/uploads/2010/07/deadbeef2.png"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-141" title="deadbeef2" src="/images/uploads/2010/07/deadbeef2-150x150.png" alt="" width="201" height="201" /></a>So is this the ffl &#8211; the foobar2000 for linux &#8211; that millions of music lovers have been waiting for? In my opinion this player has the potential to achieve awesomeness. But it has still a long way in front of it. For one there are still a lot of features missing that foobar2000 is famous for and I don&#8217;t even know whether or not the people behind deadbeef plan on implementing them. These include :</p>
<ul>
<li>a sophisticated mass-tagger (including scripts)</li>
<li>a database + search</li>
<li>replaygain scanning</li>
<li>converting</li>
<li>and last and probably hardest &#8211; a modular interface allowing for maximum configurability</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok, I admit those are quite a few high expectations I raise.</p>
<p>What do you think about? Does deadbeef look like a candidate for the next big thing? Do you think there are going to be more foobarish features? Or do other players already fill the gap?</p>
