Gilbert is working like a mad man on [naubino](http://naubino.de "naubino.js") at the moment.
This time the plan is to build it with [Kivy](http://kivy.org/).

I unfortunately have not had the time to get started helping him, yet.
But a few minutes ago I created a little doodle of what could ( perhaps ) eventually become the next logo.
Take this with a grain of salt, I exaggerated the symmetry aspect of it a little![]({{%20root_url%20}}/images/naubino_illuminati.png)
