<p>In the last couple of weeks the efforts on finishing the next big KDE plasma release have gone into super pursuit mode. Their visual design group has been putting out their 7th weekly &#8220;<a href="http://wheeldesign.blogspot.de/2014/03/monday-report-7-beach-edition.html">Monday Report</a>&#8221; with some fresh mockups and screenshots an I&#8217;ve got to say, finaly some catching up in terms of design. After gnome has made some major leaps along with their redesign of the gnome shell I was wondering when KDE would make some efforts.</p>
